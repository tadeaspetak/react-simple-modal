# Simple React Modal

Very simple react modal

# Motivation

Mostly to see what it actually entails to create an `npm` module. Also, it is useful to have a super simple modal to use in projects where [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is a flagrant overkill and [react modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) feels a bit too complex for the job.
